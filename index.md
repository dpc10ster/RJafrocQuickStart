# Preface {-}

* This online book is for those already somewhat familiar running Windows JAFROC to analyze data. 
* The Windows program has been replaced by `RJafroc`. 
* This book dives into how to use `RJafroc` to analyze ROC/FROC data.
* It starts with explanation of the dataset structures for ROC and FROC studies.
* This is followed by an explanation of DBM and OR analyses.



## TBA How much finished {-}

* HMF approximately 70%
* This book is currently (as of December 2021) in preparation.
* Parts labeled TBA and TODOLAST need to be updated on final revision.

## Coding aids (for me) {-}

* sprintf("%.4f", proper formatting of numbers
* OpPtStr(, do:
* kbl(dfA, caption = "....", booktabs = TRUE, escape = FALSE) %>% collapse_rows(columns = c(1, 3), valign = "middle") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c("basic", "scale_down", "HOLD_position"), row_label_position = "c") 
* ```{r, attr.source = ".numberLines"}
* kbl(x12, caption = "Summary of optimization results using wAFROC-AUC.", booktabs = TRUE, escape = FALSE) %>% collapse_rows(columns = c(1), valign = "middle") %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c("basic", "scale_down", "HOLD_position"), row_label_position = "c") 
* $\text{exp} \left ( -\lambda' \right )$ space before dollar sign generates a pdf error 
* FP errors generated by GitHub actions due to undefined labels:
Error: Error: pandoc version 1.12.3 or higher is required and was not found (see the help page ?rmarkdown::pandoc_available).
In addition: Warning message:
